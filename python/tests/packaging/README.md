dazl packaging/deployment tests
-------------------------------

Tests to ensure that dazl can be run on stock Linux operating systems with
minimal fuss. This primarily means pulling down the appropriate dependencies for
those operating systems.

These aren't perfect or foolproof as Docker-based versions of these operating
systems can sometimes differ in subtle ways, but they _do_ provide some
assurance that things are working as expected.
